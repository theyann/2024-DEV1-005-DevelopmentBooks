### CLI Stuff 
1. Starting The Server:

   * MacOS / Linux: ./gradlew bootRun
   * Windows: gradlew.bat bootRun (not tested)

2. Running The Tests: 
   * MacOS / Linux: ./gradlew clean test
   * Windows: gradlew.bat clean test (not tested)

    
Note: the "clean" before "test" is only there to actually see the tests results each time, as for performance purposes, gradle will only rebuild / run tests if something has changed in the code.
  
Note 2: you'll probably have a better view of what the tests are actually doing in your editor of choice, mine being (and has been for years) IntelliJ IDEA, but I don't judge!

### Implementation Notes
